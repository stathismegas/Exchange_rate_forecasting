Mitchell, International Historical Statistics: The Americas 1750-1992, Fourth Edition, New York: Stockton Press, 1998; Bureau of the Census, U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1975; Quarterly data are from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis which calculates the GDP data. Notes: Data are in billions of US Dollars. Data are disseminated in current prices and in real terms, with corresponding price indexes, for GDP and GNP by expenditure category; in current prices for national income, personal income and saving; and, in real terms for disposable personal income and per capita disposable income. Detailed data on GDP are published for the following expenditure categories: personal consumption expenditure; private fixed investment in structures;private fixed investment in equipment and software; change in private inventories; exports; imports; Federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment; state and local government consumption expenditure and gross investment. Detailed components of national income, personal income, and consumption of fixed capital are also published. Current price estimates are generally presented in billions of dollars; real measures are presented in both index form and in dollars and are calculated using the chained Fisher index formula (reference year, 1996). Quarterly estimates are seasonally adjusted and at annual rates. The geographic coverage of the data is the 50 States and the District of Columbia. All legal activities are covered (certain non-market activities by imputation). Activities reflect the entire period (year or quarter). GDP is recorded on a production timing basis; consistent with production, national income and its components are largely on an accrual basis; personal taxes are on a cash basis and personal income is largely on a cash basis. The personal sector covers households and nonprofit institutions serving individuals; the business sector covers, in addition to businesses organized for profit, mutual financial institutions, private noninsured pension funds, cooperatives, government enterprises, and nonprofit institutions that primarily serve business. Basic data include economic censuses taken at 5-year intervals; annual, quarterly, and monthly statistical surveys; decennial censuses of housing and residential finance; budgetary and administrative information, including tabulations of tax returns; and private trade sources. The United States has either already adopted, or is moving towards adopting, the most important changes included in the 1993 SNA.Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The data is collected from the FRED database. The FRED database uses data from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, The White House Council of Economic Advisors and Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The GDP methodology was revised in 2013.  This increased the 1929 values by about 1%.  To reflect this, all data prior to 1929 were increased by 1% for consistency.",
